TODO:

- adjust sample volumes sound they sound balanced relatively to each other.
- possibility to select different samples on each pad, using the control section.
- make the global volume gain adjustable, using the control section.
- maybe really subtle textures might improve the visuals (not sure tho, we want to keep the graphic/minimalist look)
